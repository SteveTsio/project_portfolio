            <p>My name is Tsiogas Stavros and from a very young age I showed passion for science and inception. I discovered that all scientists had  a love for arts and crafts 
                and as I grew up I found out why. I first took up computer sciences and telecommunications and then I turned to graphic and web design. Every day I add new skills 
                into my toolkit as knowledge can never be enough.

            <p>Everything started in June of 2015 with my internship in the Greek Film Center where I created from scratch an IT department and I took over the design and 
                implementation of the new website. The level of satisfaction was apparent as the general manager proceeded to my recruitment and assigned me the design of 
                two publications, one for the international festival in Thessaloniki and one for Berlin. Those publications were handed out in both festivals respectively.
