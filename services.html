            <p>The first service me and the rest of our experienced team offer is graphic and web design, commonly known as graphic design for print and digital applications. The term graphic design can refer to a 
                series of artistic and professional specialties that focus on the perspective and presentation. There are several methods that are used to create and combine symbols, images or/and words, in order 
                to create an optical representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer can use typography, visual arts and page 
                layout techniques in order to produce the final result. Graphic design usually refers to the process through which communication is created, 
                as well as the products that are created

            <p>«Digital marketing» is a relatively new term that became known in the last decade.
                In order to give a simple term, digital marketing is an «umbrella», underneath which, 
                fall all promotions for products or services of digital technology. Online marketing is by far the most important part of digital marketing.
                Given the fact that traditional commercial channels
                such as television and radio turn less and less popular, online marketing takes a larger part in the companies' promotion budget every day. 
                Me and my team are here to take over all these digital mediums for you.
