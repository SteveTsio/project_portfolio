                "text":" Having no talent at all with the pencil but having an eye for design and a passion for computer science i started designing my first birtday cards and invitations. The i started making wallpapers and small comics and it after a lot of work i designed my first maghazine. After tat i had the chance to design two magazines that were distributed in two of the most famous movie festivals, Berlin International Film Festival and Thessaloniki International Film Festival.

                "text":"All people think that they have to know how to design, paint , sketch or express their ideas in paper but that is not always the case. You can use any means you want at any time you want and express the deppest meaning or something that means a lot to you and only you. That is ok. Art is about expression and not elitism and about getting joy even from a well put line, not only passing messages through shock or extremism. This is why i always do my best to be true to myself and what i represent. Pink floyd created a revolution with 3 notes. Can you create a revolution with 3 colors?"
